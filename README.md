## Hooks

Hooks are a new addition in React 16.8. They let you use state and other React features without writing a class.

usage:

```JavaScript
    const [acrValues] = useAcrValues("acrValues=key1:value1 key2:value2");
    // acrValues = { key1: value1, key2: value2 }
```

### useArray

usage:

```JavaScript
    const todos = useArray(["foo", "bar"])
    todos.add("baz")
```
